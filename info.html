  <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Ether Explorations is a collaborative series consisting of compilations, webzines, and events.</p><br>
    <p>With each installation, we seek to explore the personal and collective associations we have with a different element of our external and internal worlds.</p><br>
    <p>Just as we have our own associations with the symbolic elemental structure of our own universe (earth, air, water, fire), we hold attachments to other elements as well â€“ elements, which could be emblems of other universes.</p>
