  <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Ether Explorations is a collaborative series consisting of compilations, webzines, and events.</p><br>
    <p>With each installation, we seek to explore the personal and collective associations we have with a different element of our external and internal worlds.</p><br>
    <p>Just as we have our own associations with the symbolic elemental structure of our own universe (earth, air, water, fire), we hold attachments to other elements as well â€“ elements, which could be emblems of other universes.</p>

  <h3>Event Series | earth, air, water, fire</h3>
    <p>On the second Wednesday of each month, Resonator Art Space in Norman, OK hosts a collaboratively curated evening of experimental performance by local artists.<br>
      Past performances have been in the form of sound, spoken word, movement, and film. Promotion for the events has also included visual, design, and written collaboration.<br>
      We welcome all forms of performance and installation art as a part of these events.<br>
      Write to us if you are interested in performing in one of these events in Norman or starting a series at an art space in your locality.</p>

  <h3>Webzine + Compilation Album Series | non-physical</h3>
    <p>Each webzine + compilation album focuses on the exploration of personal and/or collective associations with one non-physical element.<br>
      It could be a feeling, an abstract element of our world or a hypothetical physical element of another dimension.<br>
      Write to us if you have any suggestions of elements to explore or want to participate in any way. Everyone is welcome to contribute.</p>
