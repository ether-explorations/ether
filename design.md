#Things we need

Thanks for your intrest in helping colloborate with Ether Explorations! This is the github site which holds the code and hosts the website. I will update this page as we progress with the design process. Cheers!

## First we need a style direction to work towards
For example: what kind of overall feeling do we want the site to have, and does this ride on any pre-existing styles? Some web design examples are: 
- [modern](http://www.awwwards.com/30-grid-based-websites.html), 
- [post-modern](https://theoutline.com/), 
- [cybertwee](http://cybertwee.net/), 
- [brutalist](http://brutalistwebsites.com/)
Right now we can do pretty much whatever we want to the "skin" of the site without breaking anything. If you have a style that you like post it to the facebook thread I started in the exther explorations group about overall style direction. 

## Major assets needed
- logo (50 x 50 px)
- graphics (need to be svg eventually but I can help people with this)
- font (I {alli} can take the lead on this but feedback will be helpful
- photographs (must be at least 800px and in .png, .svg, or .jpeg format)
