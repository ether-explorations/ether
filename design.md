#Things we need

## first we need a style direction to work towards
For example: what kind of overall feeling do we want the site to have? modern, post-modern, [cybertwee](http://cybertwee.net/), [brutalist](http://brutalistwebsites.com/)

- logo (50 x 50 px)
- graphics (need to be svg eventually but I can help people with this)
- unified style (this will be colloborative, but I {alli} can throw some ideas up and we could talk about them?)
- font (I {alli} can take the lead on this but feedback will be helpful
-
