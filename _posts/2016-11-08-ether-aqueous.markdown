Ether: Aqueous is a curated drone and experimental music showcase inspired by the Journey's in Deep Sense Exploration series held on the 2nd Wednesday of each month.

Water is uncapturable. At its stillest, it can be stagnant, reflective, serene. Yet, if you try to immortalize the peace, it is disturbed. The glass shifts to fluid and the tranquil clarity is transforms into murky, obscured depths of terror. As we create, we simultaneously destroy, disrupt, and displace. We sink in and drown. Our waterlogged bodies are carried by the currents and we assimilate into the tumultuous force.
